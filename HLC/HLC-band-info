"Generating disk models" runs with MCFOST+pymcfost to generate the disk models for different dust compositions, according to Su(2017)
"Generating orthogonal polarization components" produces orthogonal polarization components from the output RT.fits files from MCFOST.
"Convolution with HLC PRF" performs the convolution of orthogonal polarization components with "HLC PRF."
"Generating raw EMCCD frames" runs the emccd_detect routine to generate raw EMCCD images.
"Adding OS9 noise and disk processing" requires OS9 MUFs from the Os9 repository
"Estimating output polarization fraction" estimates the polarization fraction from the processed disk images.
